# curve_fitting_integration
Polynomial Fitting Tool  This Python tool fits a polynomial to a set of user-provided x and y data points using the least squares method. Users can choose the polynomial degree, perform linear or nonlinear fitting, evaluate y values for given x values, and calculate the definite integral of the fitted polynomial within specified limits.


# Polynomial Fitting Using Least Squares Method

## Overview
This project implements a polynomial fitting tool using the least squares method. Users can input their data points, choose between linear or polynomial fitting, and evaluate the resulting polynomial function. Additionally, it provides functionality to calculate the definite integral of the polynomial within specified bounds.

## Features
- Fit a polynomial to given x and y data points using the least squares method.
- Choose between linear or polynomial fitting.
- Evaluate the polynomial function at a specific x value.
- Calculate the definite integral of the polynomial between two specified limits.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the NumPy library. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
