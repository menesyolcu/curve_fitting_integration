Polynomial Fitting Tool  This Python tool fits a polynomial to a set of user-provided x and y data points using the least squares method. Users can choose the polynomial degree, perform linear or nonlinear fitting, evaluate y values for given x values, and calculate the definite integral of the fitted polynomial within specified limits.
